        <h1>Introduction to Near-Earth Object (NEO) Orbits</h1>

        <p>
            Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids and comets whose orbits bring them into close proximity with Earth’s orbit around the Sun. These objects mainly originate from the asteroid belt located between Mars and Jupiter or from distant regions of the solar system. Due to gravitational interactions with planets, especially Jupiter, their original paths can change and shift toward near-Earth space.
        </p>

        <p>
            NEO orbits are typically <span class="highlight">elliptical</span> and vary in size, shape, and orientation. Some NEOs cross Earth’s orbit, while others pass nearby without crossing it. Based on their orbital characteristics, NEOs are classified into groups such as Atira, Aten, Apollo, and Amor asteroids. Their orbital periods can range from a few months to several years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Understanding NEO orbits is crucial for <span class="highlight">planetary defense</span> and impact risk assessment. By analyzing key orbital parameters such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination, scientists can predict future positions of NEOs and evaluate potential threats to Earth. Additionally, NEOs are of scientific interest and may serve as targets for future space exploration missions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, NEO orbits are dynamic and complex, influenced by various gravitational forces. Studying these orbits helps us better understand the population of near-Earth objects and their potential impact on our planet, while also providing insights into the history and evolution of our solar system.
